    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we
            have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to
            comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to
            protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

        <h3>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</h3>
        <p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely
            on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to
            process your personal information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Consent. We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your
                personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
            <li>Legal Obligations. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with
                our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise
                or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are
                involved.</li>
            <li>Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital
                interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as in situations involving potential threats to
                the safety of any person.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</h3>
        <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your
            personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e.,
            implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

        <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information
            without your consent, including, for example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely
                way</li>
            <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
            <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
            <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle
                an insurance claim</li>
            <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
            <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse
            </li>
            <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the
                accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a
                breach of an agreement or a contravention</li>

        </ul>
    </div>


    <div class="section">

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

        <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>

        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

        <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
    </div>

If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at support@tagtracker.tech.</p>

        <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
